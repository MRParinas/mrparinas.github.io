Embarking on the journey of learning to code and create a website from scratch at 50 was not just a leap into the unknown; it was a testament to the belief that it's never too late to start anew. With no prior experience in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, the venture began with a blank slate, a burning curiosity, and a willingness to dive deep into the digital creation realm.

The first steps involved understanding the basics of HTML. The challenge wasn't just in memorizing tags or syntax but in embracing a new way of thinking—structuring content in a logical and visually coherent manner. As pages began to take form, the simplicity of HTML unfolded into a canvas for creativity, each line of code a brushstroke contributing to the bigger picture.

CSS introduced an entirely new dimension to this canvas—style. Learning CSS was akin to discovering color after painting in black and white. The initially bewildering array of properties and values gradually became a powerful toolkit for bringing vibrancy and personality to the website. The excitement of transforming a static HTML page into a visually appealing experience was both empowering and exhilarating.

JavaScript was the key to making the website not just seen but interacted with. The journey through JavaScript was challenging, filled with moments of frustration and triumph. Variables, functions, and events unraveled like a puzzle, each piece a step towards making the website dynamic and responsive. It was here that the magic of coding truly revealed itself—breathing life into the static, making the digital canvas not just seen but felt.

Integrating the Bootstrap library was a pivotal moment in this journey. It offered a glimpse into the power of community and shared knowledge in coding. Bootstrap's pre-designed components and responsive grid system were not just tools for efficiency; they were lessons in best practices and design principles. Applying Bootstrap to the MyPage student portfolio website was both a practical decision for responsiveness and an educational one, learning to stand on the shoulders of giants.

The website grew, page by page—Home, Project, Bio, and a special Journey page, each telling a part of the story. The Project page showcased the ability to turn ideas into digital reality, while the Bio page offered a personal glimpse into the person behind the code. The GitHub repo links on the Journey page served as a bridge connecting the personal learning experience with the broader coding community, inviting others to view, share, and contribute.

Learning to code in Visual Studio Code was an adventure in itself. It was not just an editor; it was a cockpit from which the entire project was piloted. Mastering its shortcuts, extensions, and powerful editing features was like learning to play a new instrument, each keystroke more confident and precise than the last.

Creating a GitHub account and learning to navigate it was the final piece of the puzzle. It was here that the project transcended the confines of a personal computer and became part of the global digital tapestry. Pushing the first repository was a milestone, marking the transition from a solitary learner to an active participant in the open-source community.

Reflecting on this journey, what stands out is not just the technical skills acquired but the deeper understanding of what it means to learn, create, and contribute. At 50, starting from zero in the world of coding was a daunting endeavor, but it was also a powerful reminder that growth and change are always possible, regardless of age. This journey was not just about building a website; it was about building a new chapter in life, one line of code at a time.
